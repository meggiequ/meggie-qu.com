					<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
					<p>
						Building a family tree is the first step of Ancestry's user engagement flywheel. The more Nodes (family members) customers add to their trees, the more Hints (records matching with family members' information) we can generate for them, and the more discoveries and engagement on our sites.
					</p>
					<img src="img/gtb-flywheel.png">
					<p class="footnote">Pic. 1 Family History Product Onboarding Flywheels 2021</p>
				</div>
				<div class="stagger-tween">
					<h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
					<p>
						Only <b>69.30%</b> of users started family trees and created nodes after checkout. All the key metrics (bill through rate, active discovery rate,  3-day citation rate, etc.) were the <b>lowest</b> among users without a family tree or less than eight nodes. Users ended up canceling the memberships without experiencing the product's actual value.
					</p>
					<img class="stagger-tween-item" src="img/gtb-problem.png">
					<p class="footnote">Pic. 2 Screenshots of the product in 2021</p>

					<h4 class="stagger-tween-item">THE SOLUTION</h4>
					<p class="stagger-tween-item">
						By priming users with the value of building a family tree up front,  reducing the friction of adding family members and their information, and bringing delight and encouragement in between adding nodes, users will be more likely to start family trees and add more nodes.
						<br>
						We run the following tests to improve the key metrics and user experience:
					</p>
					
					<ul class="stagger-tween-item">
						<li>
							Reducing the friction of starting a family tree.
						</li>
						<li>
							Demonstrating the value of starting a family tree up front.
						</li>
						<li>
							Redesigning the Guided Tree Builder with a sequential structure.
						</li>
						<li>
							Incorporating animations to the family trees to show progress, spark delight, and boost the sense of achievement.
						</li>
						<li>
							Priming users with records and discoveries they could get in between adding nodes to encourage them to add more nodes.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 class="stagger-tween-item">USERS</h3>
					<p class="stagger-tween-item">Our product strategy focuses on our <b>Casual Customers</b>, the group most critical to our growth. They are more likely to subscribe to our memberships when they experience the product's value. Our UX research team clustered three segments of users: Curious, Casual, and Core. After understanding their behavior and backgrounds, I devised the <b>ocean analogy</b> to profile these three user groups. 
					</p>
					<img class="stagger-tween-item" src="img/gtb-casual.png">
					<p class="footnote stagger-tween-item" >Pic. 4 Curious, Casual, Core user profiles. Photos by @jakobowens @khandro @sebaspenalambarri on Unsplash</p>
					<p class="stagger-tween-item">Our Casual Customers are diverse in both in age and in ethnicity. Like Core, very interested in learning about ancestors and what their lives were like, but struggles with the existing experience. Family history competes with other things in their busy lives. May seem time consuming and expensive, so may dip in and out over their tenure.
					</p>
					<p class="stagger-tween-item">
						It is essential to guide this group of users to make discoveries. Time-to-discovery is very crucial to the success of their experience. Reducing friction and generating discoveries for them is critical.
					</p>
					<p class="stagger-tween-item">
						In Casual customers' voice:"I came to Ancestry to uncover mysteries, unknowns, even bombshells. I am open to anything that I might find or might arise out of this exploration. I have always felt incomplete and uncertain about who I am. I feel driven to uncover and understand things that have always felt unknown and difficult to know. Time is very important to me and I don't want to waste my time. I realize I have only just begun and that this is quite time consuming if you want to do it right."

					<h4 class="stagger-tween-item">Order confirmation</h4>
					<p class="stagger-tween-item">
						Only 25% of customers clicked start tree CTA on the order confirmation page. Even though they can access GTB on homepage, we were losing the best entry point to start a tree. By getting rid of the order confirmation page and only showing a modal with a countdown for the confirmation, we can get users to start product experience without efforts.
					</p>
					<img class="stagger-tween-item" src="img/gtb-order.png">
					<p class="footnote stagger-tween-item" >Pic. 5 Order confirmation page before vs after</p>

					<h4 class="stagger-tween-item">Intro Modal</h4>
					<p class="stagger-tween-item">
						Only 37% of customers watched the intro video on the importance of starting a family tree. Those who watched had a higher bill-through rate after the trial period. Creating animations in a carousel allows us to provide critical information without watching a one-minute video. 
					</p>

					<h4 class="stagger-tween-item">Building Family Trees</h4>
					<p class="stagger-tween-item">
						The previous Guided Tree Builder asked users to add people into the tree in a linear flow but required clicking on the tree nodes and filling forms in different views. Structuring the flow in a single view and removing clicking in and out of the tree view reduces friction. It also avoids cognitive overload and increases the completion rate by asking one question simultaneously.

					<h3 class="stagger-tween-item">DESIGN</h3>
					<p class="stagger-tween-item">One thing that we usually don't get to design but had to design in this project was our customer agent. What kind of customer agent would you trust and turn to help? With Soul Machines we have quite a few options to choose from and redesign the identity. Thus we held an identity workshop to identify how our agent will look. We had to decide the following idetities for the agent:
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="stagger-tween">
					<ul>
						<li class="stagger-tween-item">gender</li>
						<li class="stagger-tween-item">face</li>
						<li class="stagger-tween-item">clothing</li>
						<li class="stagger-tween-item">hairstyle</li>
						
					</ul>
					<img class="stagger-tween-item" src="img/agents.png">
				</div>
				<div class="stagger-tween">
					<p class="stagger-tween-item">
						To decide these, we held a workshop to brainstorm and decide what kind of identity works best with our objective. To help us brainstorm, we imagined our agent as a car, food, drinks, and etc. If the agent was a car, what kind of car it would be. And we tied it closely with our NatWest brand identity. In the end we voted Rachel from Soul Machines' model database as our agent, and we decided the hairstyle and the clothes for the model to look professional and trustworthy. 
					</p>
					<img class="stagger-tween-item" src="img/identity-workshop1.jpg"> -->
					<!-- <p class="stagger-tween-item">
						With the technologies we had, we have a lot to experiment with. We could even demonstrate the steps visually for the users to walk through the problems they encountered. But it’s also very easy to overwhelm them with too much information. We came up with a few combinations that will solve users’ problems. From sketch on a piece of paper to the screen, we explored different displays of the infomation and combination wiht the digital human agent.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="stagger-tween">
					<h4 class="stagger-tween-item">Prototype</h4>
					<img class="stagger-tween-item" src="img/cora-prototype-drawing.jpg">
					<p class="stagger-tween-item">For our first external deployment, we aimed to test it with a web browser on a PC. Firstly we needed to prototype the interface of demonstrating information with the agent in the same screen. From Soul Machines' examples, they have been placing the agent mostly in the center of the screen. As we planned to display screens to guide users through their problems, we prototyped a few ways to display the information with the agent in the screen. One of the problem we have to test was either placing the avatar on the left or right.</p>
					<img class="stagger-tween-item" src="img/leftright.png">
				</div>
				<div class="stagger-tween">
					<p class="stagger-tween-item">To decide we did both <b>A/B Testing</b> and research on the fixations on the screens. From <b>research</b> we found that people's attention leans on the left half of the page. They both suggested of placing the avatar on the left. Thus we decided to place the avatar on the left side of the screen so people would feel more comfortable while paying attention to communicating with the avatar. As the majority attention people would pay while communicating with Cora will be on herself rather than the information displayed.</p>
					<img class="uncanny stagger-tween-item" src="img/leftright2.png">
				</div>
				<div class="stagger-tween">
					<p class="stagger-tween-item">
						Another part of the interface that we needed to prototype was the <b>background</b>. In order to show the authenticity of the bank's agent, we discovered that it's best to place her with a background of a real branch. We tried a few different branch photos and even went out to take photos in our Natwest branches. In the end we chose one with Natwest's primary color decorations. However, the branch background created <b>legibility</b> issues with with the guidance information. Through a few prototypes we ended up using white background for displaying guidance and a blending transition between the white background and branch background for the avatar.

					<h3 class="stagger-tween-item">TESTING</h3>
					<p class="stagger-tween-item">Testing was an inportant part of the project. We actually have been testing throughout all phases of the projects. From internal team members to actual branch in the highstreet. Testing has helped us to make many crucial decisions and changes. We have done A/B Testing, Moderated Usability Testing, Beta Testing, Surveys and so on.</p>
					<img class="stagger-tween-item" src="img/cora-testing-internal.jpg">
				</div>
				<div class="stagger-tween">
					<p class="stagger-tween-item">Collaborating with three external teams gave us a broader employee testing group. Accessing the same content through different backgrounds gave us perspectives that we might not think of. All the four teams have tested many times to ensure their parts work well with each other. And other teams in our department were very excited to test our new prototypes.</p>
					<img class="stagger-tween-item" src="img/cora-testing.png">
					<p class="stagger-tween-item">In December 2017, we did a Beta-Testing in one of our high street branch in Liverpool. We received many meaningful feedbacks and users who participated enjoyed their interaction with Cora very much. The testing results we received were very possitive.</p>

					<h3 class="stagger-tween-item">REFLECTIONS</h3>
					<img class="stagger-tween-item" src="img/cora-team.jpg">
					<p class="stagger-tween-item">During my time at Open Experience, I have learned so much from my teammates and managers. They were mentors, examples and family to me. I'm extremly grateful for the opportunity to have worked in such a great team and met these wonderful people. Looking back at the project, there are so much I would do differently with more experience and knowledge in UX. But I learned a lot from this project.</p>
